        <h2>History of New Wave City</h2>
        <p>
          In the summer of 1992, NWC co-founders Skip and Shindog found
          themselves in a band that was breaking up. Skip, a regular on the San
          Francisco club scene from the days of the I-Beam, Earl's, Club Anon,
          Echo Beach, 181 Club and others, was disillusioned with the changes
          that had taken place in music and attitude. Raves and house music had
          taken over the scene, and everyone working in the clubs - bouncers,
          cashiers, bartenders, and even the coat check person - was suddenly
          rude. Nightclubs had become meat markets.
        </p>

        <p>
          Skip was fed up and felt that he could do a better job. Thus inspired,
          he decided to try putting together a "reunion" party of sorts for
          friends, DJs, and employees from the Haight Street nightclub called
          The I-Beam, and showcase the music of the early ‘80s we all still
          loved. A partnership with now ex-bandmate Shindog, an experienced DJ
          and promoter, was formed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The goal of the intrepid duo was to try to bring back the camaraderie,
          look, and feeling of those bygone nightlife days. With all of that in
          mind, they produced their first event together. Held on a Tuesday
          night in August at The I-Beam (because Tuesday nights were huge in the
          early ‘80s), the event featured an ’80s fashion show organized and
          curated by third partner, Samantha Hartley. Skip and special guest DJ
          Brian Raffi (former resident DJ at The I-Beam) split the turntable
          duties, and the party was a raging success. Everyone kept saying,
          "Please do it again!" And...
        </p>

        <p>
          Somehow, someway, since that groundbreaking night in 1992, **New Wave
          City is now the longest running club event in San Francisco!**
